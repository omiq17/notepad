## Evalution of Cloud

### Virtual Machine
	- Not a physical machine, exist inside a physical machine.
	- Lease resources from the mother computer - virtualization.
	- Communicate with mother computer for any task.
	- Still exists, mostly used by Data Centers.

### Internet & client-server model
	- It was difficult to communicate/transfer data between two computers.
	- Tim Berners-Lee invented WWW in 1989.
	- HTTP Procol invented.
	- Server-Client models gets popular. Server processes the request and Client sends the request.
	- Internet and Website idea boomed. Born Amazon, Salesforce. 

### SAAS (Salesforce)
	- Previously user bought CD/DVD from shop, install the software in their own PC and use it.
	- Why don't we just make that software in Server, provide to user through interner? Publisher maaintain the software in server, fix bugs and upgrade version very easily by this.
	- Salesforce, in 1999 first launced a web-based CRM.

### IAAS (AWS)
	- In special events, the website had huge traffics from users. But after the events the traffic gets low, the hardware and resources remains unused most of the time.
	- Amazon got the idea to rent their unused hardware/infrastucuture to users. 
	- They introduced EC2 (Elastic Computer Cloud) where coustomer can create their own VM by HTTP request.
	- At special events, I can rent more same configured VM/resource. Then can release when I don't need. Costing will be as per usage.
	- Intoduced S3 for storage.
	

## Cloud Computing

### What is it?
	- Cloud computing is a On-Demand availibility of computer system resources.
	- Cloud is a combination of resource allocation software and hadrware by which an end user can create his own server.

### Cloud Computing Model
	- Private Cloud: Big companies use for their own employee and resources. They want to maintain their information secured.
	- Public Cloud: Comapnies that open up thier (unused) hardwares to end users.
	- Hybrid Cloud: Mix.

### Advantages
	- I can setup my servers in many continents so that the latency time can be very less.
	- Maintaining own data center/CPU is cumbersome hard nowadays.
	- I can pay only what I have used in Cloud.

### Cloud Computing Technologies
	
#### Computing
	1. Virtual Machines
		- Owe hardwares from mother computer.
	2. Container
		- No need to setup a new OS. The mother computer can create multiple blocks (by using Docker etc) within itself. Known as Containarization.
	3. Serverless Computing
		- No need OS or container. Just deliver the code. It will run by the provider.

#### Storage
	1. Object Storage
		- Store data as object. We have metadata to get details about the object. Based on the details we play, open, read the data. Like audio, video, document, email etc.
		- Infinately scalable, no such bindings.
	2. Block Storage
		- When we need to read, write data/content very fast. Like OS, Database.
	3. File Storage
		- When we need to structure data into file/folders.
		- Noramally used by Network admin/peoples.

#### Database
	- Cloud providers has utilized the open source codes and make their own version of databases. They also maintain/run these using their own hardware. They demand that these are very fast and performant.

	1. Relational DB
		- Stores data like Excel, in row-column format. 
		- MySQL, Oracle, PostgresSQL. In cloud - AWS Aurora.
	2. NoSQL DB
		- Stores data in JSON, key-value format.
		- MongoDB. In cloud - AWS Dynamo DB.
	3. In-memory DB
		- Redis. In cloud - AWS ElastiCache.

#### Network
	1. Virtual Private Cloud: 
		- Connect multiple devices by configuting IP/gateway.
	2. Load Balancing:
		- When request comes in a high ammount to a single compouter, we create a request handler that connects to multiple computers. So, now the traffic gets divider in multiple computers. 
	3. Content Delivery Network:
		- Setup many (single purpose) server in different continents to serve static data like pdf, image, video etc. 

#### Security
	1. Identity and Access Management:
		- There will be a Super Admin, who will pay bill, manage subcribsions etc. He can manage the users also.
		- To manage users and user roles, Super Admin can create multiple groups where each group has a set of roles. Then he can assing user to respective group.
	2. Firewall:
		- Define who can access and who cannot access the resources of a computer.
		- Such as Database. We can assing particular IPs who can access it.
		- There will be a port (virtual) related to the DB and this needs to enabled to be accessed by (permitted) user.
	3. Encryption:
		- Website encryption wih HTTPS secure certificate.
		- Encryption at rest: when user upload a document from the application, we will encrypt it and then save to storage.
		- KMS: Store all the passwords encrypted a Key Management Storage. Application at first (programatically) decrypt the password from KMS and use it to login to DB.
