title: Introduction to Docker

Docker allows you to package an application with its `environment and all of its dependencies` into a "box", called a **container**.

Usually, a container consists of an application running in a stripped-to-basics version of a Linux operating system. 

An **image** is _the blueprint for a container_, a **container** is a _running instance of an image_.
