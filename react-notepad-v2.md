# React Notepad Version 2.0
Another React Notepad with lots of new notes on React. 

### State 
State is key trigger for us to update our UI.

State is a thing which can be changed by the component itself. However, props can only changed by outside.

### Virtual DOM
Virtual representation of the Actual DOM written in JS.	
React is very fast as:
- Comparison between old and new virtual dom.
- Re-renders only the changed parts in the actual dom.
    
### Stateless Component
- component without a state.
- only has props.
    
## Component Lifecycle

- **componentWillMount**: ................immediately before initial rendering
- **componentDidMount**: ................immedialtely after initial rendering
- **componentWillRecieveProps**: ...when component receive new props
- **shouldComponentUpdate**: ........before rendering, after receiving new props or states
- **componentWillUpdate**: ..............before rendering, after receiving new props or states
- **componentDidUpdate**: ...............after component's updates are flushed to DOM
- **componentWillUnmount**: ..........immediately before removing component from the DOM
