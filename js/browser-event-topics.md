**Event Bubbling**

When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handler on it, then on its parent, then all the way up to its root element (HTML).

For stopping: `event.stopPropagation();`

**Event Deligation**

One of the most potent handling patterns. By appending a single event listener to one (parent) element, we can handle multiple events generated by multiple (child) elements.
