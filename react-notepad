# React Notepad

Here I note down some topics as my learning procedure of React.

## Ecosystem
* Declarative
* Unidirectional
* Dataflow
* Composition
* Explicit Mutation
* "It's just JS"

## Code Techniques
#### Imperative
You tell your program how to do something.
#### Declarative
You tell your program what you want to do.
#### Pure Functions
* Evaluates the same result for same arguments
* Doesn't depend on and doesn't modify the states of variables out of its scope.
* No side effects (mutatoions, async reqs)

## Important Terms
#### Webpack
Allows you to take your code, run some sort of transformation on it, compile it all together and runs in one/multiple file.
In other words: Webpack, at its core, is a code bundler. It takes your code, transforms and bundles it, then returns a brand new version of your code.
#### Babel
This allows us to do that transformations.It compiles JSX to JavaScript.
A "Code Transformation" you can say.
#### Axios
It is used to make HTTP request.

## First Time Setup
 - Open terminal
 - mkdir yourFolder
 - cd yourFolder
 - npm init
 - npm install --save react react-dom
 - npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react
 - then configure your webpack.config.js, .babel.rc packege.json file and so on...

## Appendix
#### Modules
A module is just some code that we've decided to group together.
If we think about the underlying architecture of writing software, our application is usually made up of a bunch of different modules.
#### NPM
A JavaScript package manager that allows us to easily manage different packages (modules) and keep track of which version we've installed.
#### package.json file in npm
This file will, among other things, keep track of which packages or modules we've installed in your project.
#### Learn React Router

#### Four Rules of "this"
* Implicit Binding(regular)
* Explicit Binding(call, apply, bind)
* New Binding
* Window Binding
